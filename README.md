# Correlation

### Learnt About
  * *We learnt about Positive correlation and Negative(inverse) correlation*
  * *Correlation always lies in between **-1 and 1**.*
  * *Negative and Inverse correlation are same.*
   
 ### Definition
  * *.**Positive Correlation :** A correlation of **1** means the two data sets are closely(close to line) correlated.This will be a rising graph where the data points are close to the central line.*
  *  *.**Negative Correlation :** A correlation of **-1** means that the two data sets are inversely(far from line) correlated. This will be a falling graph where the data points are close to a central line.*
  *  *. **Not Correlated :** A correlation of **0** means that the two data sets are not correlated at all! The data points will be scattered on the graph.*
